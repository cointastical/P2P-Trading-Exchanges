# P2P-Trading-Platforms
## **Person-to-Person Bitcoin Trading Platforms**
Following is a list of P2P Trading Platforms (i.e., P2P exchanges) for trading bitcoin. Common payment methods include bank transfer, cash deposited in the seller's bank account, in-person cash (face-to-face) trades as well as payment networks such as Zelle, Alipay, even Cash App and PayPal, for example. Some of these payment methods are more private than others. Typically, face-to-face, cash-by-mail, and US Postal Money Orders are among the most private methods available.

Some platforms require the use of a phone number which are typically tied to personally identifying information. If a user wishes to remain anonymous, then it is recommended to use a SMS bypassing service such as [Text Verified](https://www.textverified.com/). Also, see "[Bypassing SMS Verification with Text Verified](https://archive.org/details/bypassing-sms-verification-with-text-verified)" (Wook, 2022) for an in-depth walkthrough ([PDF download](https://archive.org/download/bypassing-sms-verification-with-text-verified/Bypassing%20SMS%20verification%20with%20Text%20Verified.pdf)).
